# Instructions

You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called `result`. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list `numbers`.

**DO NOT** modify the List `numbers` directly. Try to use **List Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

# Example Output

```
[2, 8, 34]
```

# Hint

1. Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.

2. Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

3. Remind yourself of how the modulo operator works.
